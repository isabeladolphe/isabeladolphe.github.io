	<p class="text1">BREWality - Espresso Black Bier</p>
	<p class="text1a">Midnight Sun Brewing Co.</p>
	<p class="text2">Combining jet black color with incredibly smooth texture and decadent coffee flavor, BREWTALITY breaks the expectations of both rich espresso and dark beer to create a whole 'nuther beast. While brutal in alcoholic strength, this biggie beautifully showcases its roasted malt and coffee flavors without bringing on bitterness and bite. This is the first of two lagers in the series.</p>
	<p class="text3">Located in Anchorage, Alaska, MSBC is world renowned for our barrel-aged stouts and barley wines, beers that are appropriate for their less-than-temperate climate and long dark winter nights. Their core brands include IPAs and Belgian ales to cover the rest of the days when it seems the sun never sleeps, nor the people of this wild northern country.</p>
