	<p class="stouttext">STOUTS<br>Stout is a dark, top-fermented beer with a number of variations, including dry stout, oatmeal stout, milk stout, and imperial stout. Stouts are primarily made from unmalted roasted barley, which is where the coffee flavor most people associate with stout comes from.</p>
	<p class="lagertext">LAGERS<br>Lager is a type of beer conditioned at low temperature. Lagers can be pale, amber, or dark. Pale lager is the most widely consumed and commercially available style of beer.</p>
	<p class="aletext">ALES<br>Ale is a type of beer brewed using a warm fermentation method, resulting in a sweet, full-bodied and fruity taste. Historically, the term referred to a drink brewed without hops. As with most beers, ale typically has a bittering agent to balance the malt and act as a preservative.</p>
	<p class="ipatext">IPAs<br>India Pale Ales (IPAs), which encompass numerous styles of beer, get their characteristics largely from hops and herbal, citrus or fruity flavors. They can be bitter and contain high alcohol levels, though the final product depends on the variety of hops used.</p>
