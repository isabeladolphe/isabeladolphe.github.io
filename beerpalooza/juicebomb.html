	<p class="text1a">Sloop Brewing Co.</p>
	<p class="text2">The low bitterness and late hopping showcase the citrusy, juicy notes of American hops. A blast of tropical aroma is followed by a resiny and balanced flavor. Juice bomb features all the aspects and nuances of full hop flavor â€” not just bitterness. An IPA for real hop lovers.</p>
	<p class="text3">Located in Elizabeth, NY, Sloop Brewing was named after the the boats that once moved people and cargo up and down the Hudson. They focus on being grounded in the craft and tradition of brewing. Open to adventure and the pursuit of new beers, new tastes, and new experiences.</p>
