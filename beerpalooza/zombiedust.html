	<p class="text1">Zombie Dust Pale Ale</p>
	<p class="text1a">3 Floyds Brewing Co.</p>
	<p class="text2">This beer's flavor is fruity and juicy with a note of pine. It has moderately high bitterness and a smooth finish that is both malty and bitter. The hop flavors grow fruitier as it warms. There is a substantial clean, sweet malt backbone that makes this beer very close to evenly balanced between malt and hops.</p>
	<p class="text3">Located in Indiana, Three Floyds are strict adherents to the samurai code of the greman beer purity law. From our humble beginnings in 1996—armed with only a few hundred dollars, a five-barrel Frankenstein wok-burner-fired brew kettle, repurposed open Swiss cheese fermenters (Hammond Squares) and an old Canfield’s Cola tank—”It’s Not Normal” ales and lagers were born.</p>
