	<p class="text1">Nelson IPA</p>
	<p class="text1a">Alpine Beer Company</p>
	<p class="text2">Named after Nelson Sauvin, an outstanding hop varietal from New Zealand. The hop is introduced through the brewing and dry-hopping of this complex and well-balanced IPA. A hazy straw hued ale, Nelson is topped by bright white beer foam and offers a tropical hop aroma. The pine and fruity hop notes linger, but are well-balanced by the smooth, malty addition of European rye malts.</p>
	<p class="text3">Known as the “Home of Pure Hoppiness,” Alpine Beer is a small-town brewery, nestled in the foothills of the mountains just outside of San Diego. From IPAs to small-batch sours, they've been crafting high-quality ales since 1999. </p>
