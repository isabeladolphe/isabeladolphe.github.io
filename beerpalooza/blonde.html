	<p class="text2">Brewed with North American ingredients, including Pacific Northwest hops, as well as their classic Guinness yeast, Guinness Blonde is a crisp, golden beer. It has a noticeable but gentle hop aroma of citrus and tropical fruits, clean cracker-bread malt flavor and a pleasantly bitter refreshing finish.</p>
	<p class="text3">With a location in Halethorpe, MD, St. James's Gate Brewery is a brewery founded in 1759 in Dublin, Ireland, by Arthur Guinness. The company is now a part of Diageo, a British company formed from the merger of Guinness and Grand Metropolitan in 1997. The main product of the brewery is Guinness Draught.</p>
