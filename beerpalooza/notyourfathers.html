	<p class="text1a">Small Town Brewery</p>
	<p class="text2">Pour this into a glass and you'll get a deep dark brown, nearly black, and you're immediately hit with vanilla, spice and everything nice that comes with non-alcoholic root beer. It's rich, sweet and has the subtle taste of alcohol. We suggest you drink it straight from the glass, and if you're feeling frisky, add a dollop of vanilla ice cream to enjoy a classic root beer float.</p>
	<p class="text3">Located in Lackshore, IL. "Whatever your everyday hustle is, we think life is a bit sweeter when you take a step back from the day-to-day and acknowledge the small victories." </p>
