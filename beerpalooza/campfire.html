	<p class="text2">Break out the s'mores fixin's - there's a new brew in town! Inspired by cold nights around the campfire, this milk stout is brewed with marshmallows, graham crackers, cocoa nibs, cinnamon, Madagascar vanilla beans and smoked malt. The only thing missing is a tent, and a few fireside ghost stories.</p>
