	<p class="text2">El Gordo is a Russian Imperial Stout clocking in at 13.9% ABV, the legal limit in the state of Alabama. Notes of roasted malts, vanilla, bitter chocolate, and bourbon give this full-bodied stout its muscle and richness. In 2015, Paste Magazine named it the Best Non-Barrel Aged Imperial Stout in a blind taste test.</p>
	<p class="text3">Good People Brewing Co., located in Birmingham, Alabama, is a leader in the Southâ€™s craft beer movement. Founded in 2008 by Michael Sellers and Jason Malone, it was the first craft brewery in the Southeast to can its beers.</p>
